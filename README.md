# DSA_Practice Repository 

Welcome to my DSA_Practice repository! ðŸš€  

This repository serves as a collection of daily problem-solving efforts to strengthen my understanding of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. Here, I regularly upload code for problems I practice from platforms such as:  

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)  
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://geeksforgeeks.org)  
- [Coding Ninjas](https://www.codingninjas.com)  

## Topics Covered  
This repository includes solutions for problems across various fundamental and advanced DSA topics, including but not limited to:  

1. Basic Mathematics  
2. Sorting Algorithms  
3. Recursion  
4. Binary Search  
5. Arrays  
6. Linked Lists  
7. Strings  
8. Heaps  
9. Graphs  
10. Dynamic Programming (DP)  

## Why This Repository?  
This repository reflects my commitment to consistently improving my problem-solving skills and understanding of DSA concepts. It is also a way to document my journey and help others who might find these solutions useful.  

## How to Use This Repository 
Feel free to explore the code, review the logic, and practice the problems yourself. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome!  

Happy Coding! âœ¨
